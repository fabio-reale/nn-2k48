# NN-tk48

This is a Julia from scratch implementation of a Neural Network Q-Learner AI to play the 2048 game.

It started as a project for a course in USP as part of my Masters degree.

Second commit has a Julia v0.6 working prototype. The best results so far have been a 0.5% to 1% victory record. I'm currently working on porting everything to v1.0. Following that I intend to apply a different, more complex model. These efforts are slow at the moment, this is a pet project at this point.

Implementation of the neural network uses only Base Julia. In v1.0 it will be required to call `using LinearAlgebra`
